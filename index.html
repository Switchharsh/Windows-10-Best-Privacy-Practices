            These versions are already debloated from a lot of rubbish so you're off to a good start, they also only
            receive Security updates, rather than 'feature' updates. You'll find this on torrent sites (the uploader
            "Gen2" is the best and trustworthy). *Note: for anyone concerned about missing media codecs etc, just
            download K-Lite Codecs / MPC.</p>

        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The above tool is not some crappy gimmick tool as it appears, its the real
            deal. In my case, the standard DISM / SFC Repairs were not working, even after multiple fresh installs of
            windows , the "malware" survived , as i had persistent problems. This tool actually reverts everything
            forcefully back to the original/default - such as: file/owner permissions, registry permissions and default
            registry values, verifies digital signatures of all windows components, Reparse points etc.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Some 'malware' even extends to windows services. For example, if you type
            'sevices.msc' in the search bar, you can launch the services panel. Here, you can see all the windows
            services. There is a column named 'log on as'. Some services are local services, and some are network
            services. Malicious actors can hijack system services and change the log on user - this tool can help with
            that too, and optionally, you can revert any affected services manually by changing the 'log on as' to
            <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">NT AUTHORITY / Local service</strong> (password blank). (NOTE: not
            all services are supposed to be local services, im just giving you an example).

            didn't have a 'virus' &gt; kaspersky could not detect anything, malwarebytes nothing, hitmanpro, tdskiller
            (kaspersky rootkit tool). I had an issue with a malicious actor which gained access to my network, and this
            tool really helped - i suspect on every new install the old 'settings' were restored somehow.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Along with this tool, i used <a href="https://gparted.org/"

                step).</strong> We need to further debloat Windows 10. This will effectively enhance your privacy,
            security - aswell as your PC performance. To do so, we're going to run multiple scripts;</p>

        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please read the README before running the scripts. You need to enable
            execution of powershell scripts following the instructions FIRST. If you dont do this, the scripts will
            still run, but without the maximum permission required to do some of the jobs.</p>

                tool, and also includes Sycnex's tool, plus other modifications and enhancements/additions not just
                related to privacy, but also security. In my opinion it is really the best collection of scripts and the
                most effective. Totally safe to use and will not kill your search/start menu either! This is not like
                O&amp;O shutup 10, which just toggles certain settings (and closed source), this is real

                rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">NotePad++</a> and modify if necessary. For example , if you
            dont want to remove the Windows App Store, you can comment out # the line. (however, i recommend to run all
            as default - you will really feel the difference after running all these scripts, especially if you have a

        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At this stage, if executed correctly, we have significantly removed &amp;/or
            disabled a whole load of windows modules/services - and not only have we increased the privacy and security
            of the PC, but we've also increased its performance.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">ie; we've fully removed cortana, onedrive, windows defender, windows app
            store, and disabled/removed spy services, telemetry, bloatware etc. These are all modules which are
            constantly working in the background on a typical PC.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We've also added security benefits, like disabling remote desktop related
            services, unsecure services/protocols which you probably dont even know exist (not to fear, these can be
            re-enabled at any time).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So lets move on to the next section - SECURITY:</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">NO Antivirus software.</strong> These
            days AV companies offer free software, why? Because their new business is collecting your data. The AV
            software is monitoring your every move 'realtime protection', and if you enable cloud protection, its also
            sending a significant amount of data to third parties for processing.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Don't believe me?</strong> Take this
            as an example: Kaspersky has EU editions of its products, to comply with the European Unions GDPR law (which
            is essentially basic privacy laws). They also have editions of software which are not allowed to be used in
            the European Union.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">HOW TO PROTECT YOUR PC WITHOUT AV
                SOFTWARE</strong></p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The best way to protect your PC from viruses and malicious actors is to;</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">a: learn how to use the internet safely; ie; dont download random apps from
            shady websites, etc.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">b: install <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">'UBlock ORIGIN' and 'HTTPS
                EVERYWHERE'</strong> as 'extensions / plugins' for Chrome (if you use Chrome) or Firefox (if you use
            Firefox). Additionally, install the <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">'NoScript'</strong> plugin into
            the browser you use for lesuire purposes (its best to keep one browser for work, and one for lesuire). The
            reason i don't add <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">'NoScript'</strong> to my 'work browser' (which
            is Chrome), is because it can break some sites, or require you to add an exception to make that site work as
            intended &gt; which takes you off track from focusing on work.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Each browser (especially FireFox) has additional measures you can take to
            enhance its privacy / security. But i wont get into those details here, you can find them in other threads.
            But you'll want to do things like disable WebRTC, disable the built in 'smart screen protection' etc.</p>

            simple actually) - its awesome. You can block internet access to specific system modules, apps, etc. You can
            also block IP Addresses, including its built in list of Telemetry IP addresses.</p>

                remote registry , event viewer, remote shell, etc. This will ensure that those specific windows modules

                wide' block rules blocking common filesharing and exploit ports system-wide (this is usually done on the
                router firewall, but it wont hurt to do them on both the OS and router side for an extra layer of
                protection - since most consumer routers have built-in backdoors and exploits). Proof of that is

            you can start with a 'block all' approach (recommended), and work your way up (allowing things which you
            use). For example, You can only allow Chrome to talk on port 443 and port 80 , any other port is blocked,
            etc. You can block Microsoft office from the internet (a good idea as many remote attacks target MS Office
            documents), etc. (side note: i recommend using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/"
                class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">SIMPLEWALL can log all blocked traffic - so youll get a real understanding of
            what your PC is doing. Use this instead of Microsoft's built in firewall. (We'll still configure the Windows
            Defender Advanced Firewall via Group Policy - will get to the later in the thread).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If this seems all too much for you - DONT STRESS. The default configuration
            of SIMPLEWALL is already effective and provides a great layer of security. You'll notice right away, with
            its default built in block settings (for example, when you launch chrome you may get a pop up that chrome is
            trying to use mDNS on port 1900, click 'block' and it will block chrome doing that forever).</p>

            prevents rootkits, bootkits, and ransomware, such as Petya Ransomware, from overriding the operating
            system’s boot loader. Ransomware, like Petya, overwrite and encrypt the victim’s Master File Table (MTF) to
            coerce them into paying for an encryption key.</p>

            prevent write access to your systems boot loader, rendering many of the most advanced malware

        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">How to install it?</strong> It's a
            one time installer (not a software package) - the precompiled version comes in the form of a driver (1 click
            install). (its open source if you compile it yourself from the source code - its not open source if you
            download the easy 1 click pre-compiled installer). After installation, you wont find it in your 'program
            files', it works just like a script.</p>

        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So youll need to research those yourselves.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Group Policy is an advanced tool
                vital for your PC's security.</strong></p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">You need to picture Windows 10 as
                being in like a 'virtual environment'. What do i mean by this?</strong> I mean, Windows 10 has a
            hierarchy system. For example, if you work in an office, and use an office PC - sure, you can set your own
            local firewall rules. But if the network administrator blocks <a href="https://www.example.com"
                class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">www.example.com</a> from the
            'head office / management' side, you cant do anything locally to unblock it (or vice versa). This is how
            group policy works. Group policy is the 'head office / management' of windows 10.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Group policy &gt; Windows Settings
                &gt; Security Settings &gt; Windows Defender Firewall With advanced Security.</strong> This is the
            'parent' defender, which can override the standard defender (that we removed in the scripts above). If you
            have already configured some rules in the 'standard' defender, then i recommend to check out the group
            policy defender now. You will see that none of your configuration exists. It is a common tactic of malicious
            actors to take over your machine. If you never configured the group policy defender, they can bypass all
            your 'standard' defender rules through group policies defender application. So this is a great step to learn
            how windows really works, and how to secure it properly.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You'll also want to configure other security related group policy settings.
        </p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For example, if you were using the standard Windows DEFENDER Firewall (even
            the 'Windows 10 advanced firewall' client-side), and your PC was compromised (taken over by a malicious
            actor) - they can override all your local firewall rules without any effort. But if you had group policy in
            place, and set your firewall rules from WITHIN group policy, then you will make it very difficult for the
            malicious actor to override your system settings and gain access.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is very strange and stupid, how Windows 10 works like that. The
            'client-side' Windows DEFENDER Firewall provides a false feeling of security, at best. Not forgetting that
            new rules pop up out of no where, allowing access to things you never gave permission too, all by itself.
            Even when you disable rules it automatically generated, you will find later that it adds new rules again to
            bypass your configuration).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">If you dont have group policy in
                place, the malicious actor will become your 'group policy manager'.</strong></p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Remember that the firewall in GROUP POLICY has separate rules for the public
            network, domain network, and private network. You need to set all the rules in each category (they are all
            equally as important - do not think "oh, i dont use a domain network so ill just leave that"). The DOMAIN
            network is a common backdoor entry point (sometimes referred too as Active Directory/ MS AZURE).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To avoid confusion: I recommend to configure the windows firewall in GROUP
            POLICY, PLUS the simplewall firewall mentioned above - this will provide the maximum level of security from
            unauthorized access to your PC.</p>

        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">------------------------------------</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Guys, thanks for your appreciation, and i hope ive helped someone out.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I just want to mention that if you're not really comfortable without having a
            'proper' antivirus - feel free to use a third party AV (i still dont recommend defender).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">If i personally had to choose a third
                party AV, it would probably be Kaspersky Internet Security - based on its actual performance, and not on
                any other factors (although i dont, i do exactly what i mentioned in this guide).</strong></p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Do not use any free AV, as you know, nothing is free in this world - you are
            usually the product. All free AV including kaspersky uses cloud based protection. With the paid version of K
            internet security, you have the option to not enable the KSN (kaspersky cloud protection) - and you can buy
            a license cheap from ebay (genuine).</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just remember with whatever provider you choose, make sure you dont have the
            'ssl inspection' / 'web protection' setting enabled - because the software will MiTM every website you
            visit, which is both a security issue and a privacy issue.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Also, make sure you're not protected via cloud - because literally, all of
            your files metadata (like barcodes) are known and all of your 'machine behaviour' analyzed and you can be
            profiled. Depending on who you are, where you are located, and what you do - this can be important to you.
            For example, journalists, researchers, or living in strict countries - suspicious or known hashes of
            targeted files/documents and so forth can be collected.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We dont even know what the AV is collecting without cloud based protection,
            and many (including kaspersky) that dont even comply with BASIC GDPR laws. You definitely shouldn't 'sign
            in' to 'my kaspersky' and link yourself to their portal.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Here is a great example:</strong></p>
        <div class="_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF"><a
                href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/kaspersky-yes-we-obtained-nsa-secrets-no-we-didnt-help-steal-them/"
                class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Kaspersky: Yes, we obtained
                NSA secrets. No, we didn’t help steal them.</a></div>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As soon as Kaspersky identified (automatically/systematically) the malware
            being related to the NSA - they immediately notified the NSA. Which proves my point. Maybe you're a security
            researcher that found some leaked malware on github, or simply a geek, data hoarder. The AV software may
            work against you - putting you on a watch list.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">You need to find the right balance
                between privacy and security - it's not the same for everyone, and you cant have the best of both
                worlds. To have better security, you need to sacrifice some privacy. To have better privacy, you need to
                sacrifice some security.</strong> In my opinion, and based on my useage of my PC's, i think i've hit the
            sweet spot with this guide.</p>
